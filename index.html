        Five Park unites timeless glamour with a new, multidisciplinary approach
        to development. The site pairs a soaring residential building — The
        tallest in Miami Beach — with an expansive three acre public park,
        tasteful retail inclusion, and the creation of an art-inspired bridge
        that connects the community south of fifth into a walkable wonderland
        surrounded by Florida’s pristine waters. In addition to coastal
        surrounds, an ever-blue bay, and a carefully curated ecological park,
        Five Park offers a host of amenities that underscore the importance of
        living well and wellness itself. On-site work spaces, thoughtfully
        designed fitness areas, pools with sweeping views of Florida’s
        coastline, events and areas designated for families, and units designed
        to accommodate your every need invite you to embrace \the transformative
        nature of a place like Five Park.
      </p>

      <h4>BEACH LIFE AT NEW HEIGHTS</h4>
      <p>
        There’s only one constant in life — change. Some places eke out an
        inflexible identity, seeking a solid foundation or era to plant their
        feet firmly and dig their heels in to. Others are more mutable, willing
        to cast off associations and judgments, eager and able to begin again
        and reinvent themselves, as adaptable as a light breeze and as flexible
        as swaying palms. Miami Beach is one of those places and Five Park is
        the epicenter of transformation, ushering in a new decade and an era of
        unprecedented communal and personal change. Step into this new era and
        experience all that Miami Beach has to offer.
      </p>
      <h4>
        THE MIAMI BEACH OF TODAY IS UNAPOLOGETIC, FIZZLING WITH NEW CREATIVE
        FRISSON, AND ENTIRELY YOURS TO DISCOVER.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Helmed by renowned architecture and planning studio, Arquitectonica,
        Five Park represents the intersection of function, beauty, and
        sustainability. This cylindrical marvel draws its curvilinear form from
        the undulating waves that reflect the ecology and culture of Miami
        Beach. Five Park’s elliptical floor plans serve to optimize dweller’s
        access to abundant natural light and expansive views of the city, water,
        and park below while also opening visual access in communal areas,
        corridors, and accessible terraces. Verdant and lush terraces bring
        earth to sky, but they also help modulate the building’s heating and
        cooling, adding a layer of smart technology to this well-considered
        ecosystem. Resourceful techniques improve the building’s approach to
        water quality, water management, and heat load.
      </p>
      <h4>
        SUBLIME VIEWS AT EVERY ANGLE—WHITE SAND SWATHES PUNCUATED BY VIBRANT
        GREENS AND BUBBLY BLUES. BEYOND, A VIVID CITYSCAPE, HOME TO TOWERING
        PALMS AND PLEASURE SEEKERS, THOSE READY AND WILLING FOR A LIFE AS
        EXPANSIVE AS THE COASTLINE STRETCHING OUT BEFORE THEM.
